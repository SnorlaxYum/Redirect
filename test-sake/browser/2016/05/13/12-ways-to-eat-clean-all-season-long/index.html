We've got the 12 cleanest, healthiest, low- and no-carb picks found throughout the holiday season. Healthy holidays are happy holidays! (Source: <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/12-ways-to-eat-clean-all-season-long.html" target="_blank">BodyBuilding</a>)  </p>
<p>The holidays are almost upon us—and with them, a not-so-merry minefield of edible indulgences. Becoming savvy about the chemical makeup of what's on the buffet table—be it pre-packaged cookies, frozen hors d'oeuvres, processed grains, or refined sugars—can keep you lean and fit without your missing out on the fun.  </p>
<p>"Clean eating is about avoiding packaged products and engaging in a diet rich in non-processed foods—things that come from the earth," says Manhattan-based nutritionist Sharon Richter, R.D. "Think fruits, vegetables, and lean protein sources, like fish."  </p>
<p>Give yourself the gift of good eating this season with 12 of our favorite ways to indulge in the flavor of the holidays without packing on pounds.  </p>
<h3>1 / Dark Green Vegetables</h3>
<p><img src="https://test.snorl.ax/browser/2016/05/13/12-ways-to-eat-clean-all-season-long/img/dark-green-vegetables.jpg" width="570" height="326" />  </p>
<p>These healthy finger foods are a powerful source of cardiovascular-boosting folate and also very low in carbs (four spears of <a>asparagus</a> contain only 2.5 grams). So, whether it's raw <a>broccoli</a>, asparagus, or baked <a>kale</a> chips, these slimming snacks have the satisfying bonus of crunch.  </p>
<h3>2 / Shellfish</h3>
<p>Found on many a holiday-party table, <a>shrimp</a> cocktail, raw <a>oysters</a>, and <a>clams</a> with a spritz of <a>lemon</a> add a super-low-fat, no-carb protein punch to festive snacking, with an added boost of <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/zinc.html">zinc</a> and <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/vitb.html">vitamins B</a> and <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/vitd.html">D</a>.  </p>
<h3>3 / Cinnamon</h3>
<p><img src="https://test.snorl.ax/browser/2016/05/13/12-ways-to-eat-clean-all-season-long/img/dark-cinnamonc.jpg" width="325" height="306" align="right" />Not only does this spice conjure up images of warm kitchens and festive baked goods, it also happens to be incredibly good for you.  </p>
<p>A natural bacteria fighter and memory booster, <a>cinnamon</a> is also a great flavor enhancer on treats like baked <a>apples</a>, Richter says. One teaspoon has only two grams of carbs and six calories.  </p>
<h3>4 / Matcha</h3>
<p>It's easy to be tempted by a high-calorie, cream-laden latte, but one tall Starbuck's peppermint white-chocolate mocha has 410 calories and 15 grams of fat. Instead, opt for matcha.  </p>
<p>This powdered, whole-leaf green tea has zero carbs and is loaded with antioxidants that boost energy and improve brain function.  </p>
<h3>5 / Lean Meats</h3>
<p><img src="https://test.snorl.ax/browser/2016/05/13/12-ways-to-eat-clean-all-season-long/img/lean-meats.jpg" width="570" height="329" />  </p>
<p>Opt for lean, baked <a>turkey</a> or <a>chicken breast</a> at the party's carving station and you can have a clean, protein-packed meal with half the fat of beef. Bonus: A three-ounce serving is a low-carb treat with nearly 20 grams of protein.  </p>
<h3>6 / Pomegranate</h3>
<p><img src="https://test.snorl.ax/browser/2016/05/13/12-ways-to-eat-clean-all-season-long/img/pomegranate.jpg" width="241" height="142" align="right" /><a>Pomegranates</a> are abundant during the winter months (and make a festive centerpiece at any holiday gathering). They're also a potent source of antioxidants kicking bad cholesterol, jacked-up blood pressure, and carcinogens to the curb. A half cup of seeds has 16 grams of carbohydrates, but it's also got three healthy grams of fiber and 15 percent of your daily dose of vitamin C.  </p>
<h3>7 / Tomatoes</h3>
<p>Condiments are a big no-no when trying to eat clean, so instead of reaching for corn-syrup-laden <a>ketchup</a> or sodium-packed <a>salsa</a>, go for chopped tomatoes with slivered <a>fresh basil</a> for minimal carbs and plenty of vitamin C.  </p>
<h3>8 / Dark Chocolate</h3>
<p><img src="https://test.snorl.ax/browser/2016/05/13/12-ways-to-eat-clean-all-season-long/img/dark-chocolate.jpg" width="389" height="234" align="right" />It's kind of hard to believe something that tastes so decadent could be good for cardiovascular health—not to mention can help fight premature aging and cancer.  </p>
<p>But it's true: A one-ounce square is only a 13-gram carbohydrate indulgence.  </p>
<h3>9 / Roasted Garlic</h3>
<p>Aromatically irresistible and delicious as a spread on whole-grain toast points, <a>garlic</a> is also a powerful antioxidant and immune-boosting power food that increases blood flow and lowers cholesterol.  </p>
<p>That's not all: One clove of roasted garlic has only one gram of carbs.  </p>
<h3>10 / Citrus</h3>
<p><img src="https://test.snorl.ax/browser/2016/05/13/12-ways-to-eat-clean-all-season-long/img/citrus-fruit.jpg" width="570" height="357" />  </p>
<p>Abundant in the winter months, citrus fruits are versatile, colorful, immune-boosting beverage companions. Yes, fruit does have carbs—that six-ounce glass of orange juice has 18 grams per ounce—but it's accompanied by a whopping 150% serving of your daily requirement of vitamin C.  </p>
<h3>11 / Salmon</h3>
<p><img src="https://test.snorl.ax/browser/2016/05/13/12-ways-to-eat-clean-all-season-long/img/salmonb.jpg" width="223" height="287" align="right" />At your next holiday party, feel free to indulge in that plate of <a>salmon</a>. You'll get not just a healthy shot of omega-3 fatty acids but a jolt of B3s and 12s to boot, says Richter.  </p>
<p>Just make sure you look for wild-sourced versions, as they tend to be healthier than farmed fish.  </p>
<h3>12 / Whole Grains</h3>
<p>Refined grains have their healthy bran and germ stripped away, so all their good-for-you properties are lost in the process, too.  </p>
<p><a>Whole-grain crackers</a>, <a>bread</a>, pita, popcorn, and <a>brown rice</a>, on the other hand, are great sources of munchable complex carbohydrates (a one-ounce serving of whole-wheat crackers has about 19 grams of carbs, and the carb content of one cup of airpopped popcorn is only six grams) with loads of magnesium, selenium, and fiber. They're also low in fat but big on texture and flavor.  </p></div><footer id=q><b>Created:&nbsp;</b><time datetime="2016-05-13T00:56:00+02:00">May 13, 2016</time><span id=y>•</span>In a <a href="https://test.snorl.ax/browser/"rel="category tag"><b>Browser</b></a> Session<span id=y>•</span><b>Tags:&nbsp;</b><a href="https://test.snorl.ax/tags/bodybuilding/"rel=tag>BodyBuilding</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://test.snorl.ax/tags/fitness/"rel=tag>Fitness</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://test.snorl.ax/tags/food/"rel=tag>Food</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://test.snorl.ax/tags/health/"rel=tag>Health</a></footer></article>
